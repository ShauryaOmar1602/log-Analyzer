LogAnalyzer is a Python-based tool designed to process web server log files to extract valuable information about traffic patterns and detect potential security issues. It counts the number of requests per IP address, identifies the most frequently accessed endpoints, and flags suspicious activities such as brute force login attempts. The results are displayed in the terminal and saved to a CSV file for further analysis. This tool is ideal for system administrators and cybersecurity professionals to monitor and analyze server logsÂ efficiently.
